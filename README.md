# TheOfficalScrabbleGame
Our Scrabble game is played with two players, human and computer, in which each player begins with seven letters and must form a word out of them,
building off from letters already placed on the board. The player with the highest score when the pool of 100 letters runs out wins.

Current bugs: program crashes when playing a word.
